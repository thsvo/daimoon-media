            "Q": "Why was DaimoonMedia established?",
            "A": "Daimoon, interestingly, began as an artist project. Following our founder's deep desire to master the art of music marketing in order to grow this career, the results convinced him that many more artists should have access to these resources.<br /><br /><br />We first developed <a style='color: #B165ED' target='_blank' href='https://daimoon.market/'>Daimoon Market</a>, which brings artists and influential music curators together. After which we developed our expertise across Spotify, SoundCloud and YouTube, and established ourselves as a top-rated promotion agency within the professional industry."

            "Q": "How large is the DaimoonMedia team",

          {
            "Q": "How is DaimoonMedia different from other music promotion websites?",
            "A": "We do everything a little differently. As opposed to “a promotion website”, we’re really an agency made up of a diverse group of people who embrace the same vision.<br /><br /><br />Since the beginning we've focused on developing genuine relationships and acquiring top-level knowledge that aid in the development of artists.<br /><br /><br />To support your growth, we go as deep as building our own technological ecosystems and tools that help us manage and deliver the best results, giving you an advantage over everyone else."
          },
          {
            "Q": " Is DaimoonMedia really accessible to anyone?",
            "A": "Yes! We work with the industry's biggest and fastest-growing artists as well as first-time releasers and basically anyone in between.<br /><br /><br />From the top-down we've got you covered with our <a style='color: #B165ED' target='_blank' href='/blogs'>free articles and studies</a>  to help you learn more and get inspired to maximize the success of your career and campaigns."

            "Q": "How can DaimoonMedia help me emerge my/an artist career?",
            "A": "Outside of the promotions on the website we have developed an exclusive array of services assembled into growth trajectories, curated to your specific goals and ambitions, that we offer to a small group of artists and commit to on a longer-term basis only.<br /><br /><br />You can learn more about our <a style='color: #B165ED' target='_blank' href='/contact?key=customer&partner'>Strategy Campaigns</a> here and contact us to discover if we’re a good fit!"

            "Q": "Is cereal soup?",
            "A": "Solid question. And thanks for opening this box. At Daimoon, however, we don’t pass judgment on things based on what they are or how they are used. We look at where we can get it to and how we'd do that most effectively. Like getting pineapple pizza onto the right plates."
          },
          {
            "Q": "I have not received an email or any communication from Daimoon",
            "A": "After completing your order we directly send an email confirmation. Check if this ended up in your spam. If not, let’s figure out if the email address we have matches the one you’re reading out!"
          },
          {
            "Q": "I want to schedule a campaign, what can I expect?",
            "A": "We’ll walk you through! You can schedule a promotion with us if you want your promotion to start in the future. This could be if your song or video isn’t on streaming services yet because it’s yet to be released or simply because you prefer to time your promotion for a date in the future."
          },
          {
            "Q": "What happens if I start multiple promotions at once?",
            "A": "With the new optionality to order multiple promotions in one session we save you a ton of time. You can still set individual targets for every song/video and we’ll treat any promotion at an individual level, kind of as if you ordered them separately. As every promotion might have different targets we will make sure each song gets the attention it deserves!"
          },
          {
            "Q": "Can I promote multiple songs or videos at once?",
            "A": "Definitely. You asked, we listened. With the recent website update you can now book multiple promotions in one session, across all platforms, with only one check-out! Just start with one song or video, add the songs/videos you want to promote and curate all individual campaigns up to your needs. We’ll always help you remember adding the right songs before you check out."
          },
          {
            "Q": "Where can I find my campaigns?",
            "A": "Once you’ve started a campaign, you’ll receive updates over email about pitches, placements, views, reposts and more. At all times we’ll link back to your private dashboard where you’ll be able to follow all campaign progress during and after your campaign!"
          },
          {
            "Q": "Can I edit my campaign after submitting?",
            "A": "If you’re really quick, you can send over some final changes to the team. However, because our campaign team moves with the speed of sound, we can’t always promise that those requests will be seen in time.<br/><br/><br/>Once we have started your campaign, meaning we have sent out the first pitches (Spotify & SoundCloud) or generated the first views (YouTube), it’s not possible to change your campaign. This includes canceling."
          },
          {
            "Q": "I want to extend my campaign!",
            "A": "This is definitely possible. For now, you can curate and order the relevant promotion for the same song and/or video. You can include a note to give us a heads up about continuing the previous campaign.<br/><br/><br/>In the future, we’ll make this even easier by allowing you to extend your promotion right from your personal campaign dashboard."

          {
            "Q": "I’m unsatisfied with my results, what can I do?",
            "A": "Sorry to hear that! We always do the best we can to give you maximum exposure for your budget and align with the expectations we set out while you build your campaign.<br/><br/><br/>If, however, you see that these don’t align, please let us know and get in touch with our campaign team to analyze your results so we can make sure to set out the next steps that will successfully finish your campaign!<br /><br /><br />Please include the following for the fastest results:<br /><br /><br />- Your order number<br />- The results you expected from your campaign and what you actually received.<br />- For Spotify: Screenshot(s) of the song’s Spotify for Artists dashboard, displaying all the placed playlists and the number of streams received since 2015.<br /><br /><br/>Connect to the team through our help submission form."
          },
          {
            "Q": "Can I build my campaign before my song or video is online?",
            "A": "Yes! You can pre-order a promotion by filling out the release date of your song instead of the song URL. On the day of release you can send us your song URL, so we can start with the promotion. We’ll always remind you about this.<br/><br />If you already have a private listening link that you can share, you can send us that link instead. That way we can then start preparing the promotion prior to the release date!"

            "Q": "Why are we confident to take your campaign before hearing your music?",
            "A": "After years of networking in the industry, we have so many relationships that we can normally get your song pitched to curators with playlists that fit and are willing to accept it on their list. <br/><br/> But what happens when that’s not the case? On the rare occasion, we think we won’t be able to match your song with Spotify playlists, or if curators start to reject your music, we’ll simply refund you the ordered amount, in full."
          },
          {
            "Q": "How exactly will my Spotify promotion work?",
            "A": "Once you’ve set your reach and stream targets we’ll immediately start internal planning to determine which curators and playlists are best suited to your project and song(s). When we’re ready, we’ll set up a pitch strategy and start pitching your song. You’ll be notified about any playlists we pitch to, and whether they have rejected or accepted our pitch. <br /><br /><br />We repeat this process until the targets of the campaign have been secured.<br /><br /><br />Through your private dashboard you’ll be able to follow all campaign progress along the way! Once we’ve concluded our initial pitches and placements it’s time to measure their success in the weeks following in order to confidently finish your campaign."

          {
            "Q": "How long will it take for my first placements to appear?",
            "A": "Due to our speed and extended relationships we can usually confirm your first placements within 1-3 days. Since we’re always reliant on the schedules and judgment of curators we have to allow for exceptions! This will always be within 7 days."
          },
          {
            "Q": "Will my promotion comply with the Terms of Service of Spotify?",
            "A": "As our promotions are entirely based on pitching to independent curators across the platform we fully comply with all the terms and conditions of Spotify itself. All of the playlists we work with are created and grown through advertising, influencer marketing, and high search positions within the Spotify search results (SEO).<br /><br/><br />To secure this we created PlaylistProtocol (DPP), a protocol that verifies and secures the legitimacy of any playlist on Spotify through in-depth analysis that includes streaming volume, playlist growth timelines, listener locations, account followers, and a ratio between those and more metrics."
          },

We don’t seek curators for detailed feedback; instead we focus on ensuring the speed of your success by accurately identifying curators who’ll most likely fall in love with your music. If anything tends to run off-track after multiple pitches, we’ll contact you with the general feedback we received to come to a solution!"

            "A": "We do not hard-guarantee a fixed number of streams, simply our strong promise to deliver our best service possible in order to meet your campaign targets, which we preferably exceed, proven by our years of successful campaigns.<br /><br /><br />We do provide reliable stream and placement estimates that will result from your campaign. If anything ends up running off-track, we’ll find a way to arrange a solution!<br /><br /><br />In line with this, we won’t be able to promise playlist durations and positions, but we aspire to achieve at least 4 week placements and top 50 playlist positions. We typically succeed in reaching these goals across campaign placements."

We’ll keep a nice overview of the playlists we’ve pitched, received placements on and received declines for, as well as the total reach we’ve generated, alongside some other details. <br/><br/><br/>If you’re eager to review results on a deeper level, you can consult your Spotify for Artists account by logging in, heading over to the relevant song and monitoring the streams it has generated over certain periods of time. Simultaneously you can learn more about the track’s save rate and algorithmic stimulus by analyzing the on-platform traffic sources.<br/><br/><br/>If you want to go even deeper, you can check out playlist and profile statistics through a paid account on Chartmetric or Spot on Track."

          {
            "Q": "Why has my song been removed from a playlist(s)?",
            "A": "Most curators have a high submission rate and therefore allow for high track rotation. This allows as many artists as possible to be in the spotlight. We aspire to achieve at least 4 week placements but we can never guarantee this. Our solution to such variables is to build some margin by initially reaching more followers than necessary so we can, down the line, always secure an appropriate result for you."

            "Q": "Why are my results not adding up to the expectations?",

If this is the case, please reach out to us and our campaign team will take a look at it as soon as possible.<br/><br/><br/>​​Please include the following information for the fastest results:<br/><br/><br/>- Your order number OR the link to your campaign dashboard (Spotify only).<br/><br/>- Screenshot(s) of the song’s Spotify for Artists dashboard, displaying all the placed playlists and the number of streams received since 2015.<br/><br/>- Your campaign size and expected results (as seen on the DaimoonMedia website when a campaign is curated)."

            "Q": "The genre of a playlist doesn’t match my song?",
            "A": "This happens! Sometimes we execute wider pitches because we expect to reach better results that way. When curators end up liking the track we will always accept their offer to add it because we want as much exposure for you as possible. A requirement is that it won’t be a total mis-match, as this might not benefit you. If that’s the case, and we haven’t spotted it yet, please reach out to our team and we’ll figure out a removal and replacement."

In that time our curator network has expanded and contains a wide range of curators from different genres – so we’re sure that we will be able to find curators that want to work with your song!"
          },
          {
            "Q": "Is geographical targeting supported with playlist marketing?",
            "A": "Due to the nature and themes of the playlists we work with we mostly find listeners to come from western countries.<br/><br/><br/>This is usually prefered by most marketers, however it is a common misconception to presumably exclude non-western countries as these listeners can be hugely beneficial to your positions in Spotify (trigger cities). Taking all the above in consideration, we won’t be able to deliver exact geographic targeting in our service."

            "Q": "What is the status of my campaign?",
            "A": "The status of all your campaigns can be tracked via your private campaign dashboard. You’ll receive your private campaign dashboard together with our email of confirming your first placements. Here’s what each status means:<br/><br/><br/>- In progress: We’re listening to your song to identify which playlists will be the best fit for your song and which curators are most likely to accept your song. We work with both in-house curators and external curators.<br/><br/>- Being pitched: Your song has been pitched to the relevant curator(s) and we are awaiting their response. When the first curator accepts your song it can take up to 2 working days to actually place the placement. If a curator declines your song then it means the process will be delayed, often taking more than 7 working days.<br/><br/>- Finished: Your campaign is now running and has received all initial placements. Your song will be added to the displayed playlists and we expect the campaign to finish successfully with these placements. If we get clarity on this, you can even find how long your song will remain in these playlists."

On top of that, we periodically check if curators we already work with still have authentic people listening to their playlists.<br><br>This ensures that if you get featured, your music gets actual listeners streaming your track and appreciating your work while your entire catalog stays safe and protected. These statements are backed by our strong 4.8-star Trustpilot reputation."

We take every possible measure to protect our artists and handle every campaign with care, making sure your investment is not only safe, but also leads to long-term growth that benefits your music and career.<br><br>That said, in 2023, there were a few isolated cases that didn’t go as expected. As part of our transparency, we don’t hide this. A few artists did receive strikes, which led to music being taken down. It was one of our darkest periods. We genuinely care about the artists we work with, and we did everything within our power to prevent and revert it.<br><br>This led to a massive cleanup and periodic check-ups of curators. Every lesson was taken seriously and new processes were implemented to make sure it would never happen again.<br><br>Since then, we’ve maintained a clean track record. For the past 2 years (since Jan 2024), we’ve had zero takedowns, and we’re proud to say we’ve become the most reliable agency you can trust with your music.

This ensures that your video will continue to grow during and after the campaign has finished as it will be placed in Suggested Videos and other algorithmic recommendation systems within YouTube. This will further increase your exposure and ad revenue.<br/><br/><br/>Keep in mind, the amount of ad revenue is extremely dependent on your channel’s CPM costs. You can further look into this within your YouTube Studio account."

This allows us to ensure your marketing budget will get you the best return possible.<br /><br/><br />Additionally there are also a lot of traps within advertising on YouTube, where your marketing could actually be hurting your video and channel growth. It helps to have this knowledge under the belt and easily avoid such mistakes."

            "Q": "Why are some territories more expensive than others?",
            "A": "There are a lot of variables in play here, but most importantly it’s because of the competition in such countries, where you’re competing for people’s attention together with big brands and conglomerates. This competition increases the prices Google can ask per view. Other factors in play are, for example, that most users in certain territories use ad blockers.<br/><br/>Additionally, narrowing your targeting to one territory in general compromises the strategy we’ve developed, that on the first hand allows this low pricing, and therefore we will have to charge more for the same result."

            "A": "Normally, your promotion will start within 3 days after purchase. Of course, we’ll always have to account for unforeseen circumstances, for example when Google might suspect explicit content (we explain this within another answer). If, within 7 days, we cannot get your campaign running due to external factors, we will reach out to you and arrange a solution!"

You can think of:<br/><br/><br/>- Content that harasses, intimidates, threatens, bullies, discriminates, uses violent language, harms or incites hatred<br/><br/>- Content that contains or promotes illegal substances<br/><br/>- Content containing text, image, audio, or video of graphic sexual acts intended to arous<br/><br/>- Content containing political subjects"
